If you’re not familiar with any of the names on the list so far, do not fear, Shakespeare is here! Also dubbed Sonnet 18, this short poem is more than just about love, it’s about the memory of it, and a very real, human fear that we, in time, will be forgotten. One of the most meaningful short poems written, throw in some hyperbole, repetition, and a couple of striking similes, and you have a sonnet for the ages. On another note, did you know that Shakespeare had an affinity for weed? More on that here.
